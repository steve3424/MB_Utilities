- CT Process Files
	-- Why load files into list and then go through them, why not go through each file with Enumerate.Files or something ??
	-- Have doc list loaded from file so it is easy to change without recompiling AND have default list if file is not found

- CT Process Stragglers
	-- Skip "- BAD" files when checking file names
	-- Load "- BAD" into list to check if it is TD, then output UiPath list to modify to NN
	-- Show Warning doesn't need to be a function.

- CT Create Lists
	-- Refactor "- BAD" NN chart processing
	-- Abstract out LoadFileNames()
	-- Move RG, TD, and VD list to Missing List modules
	-- createStragglerLists() enumerates files when we already load files into hashset
	-- Refactor word doc creation
		--- createAccountabilityLists(missingList, voidedList, stragglerList, date, hospitalCode=(GV,CT))
		--- file name should be (GV,CT)_accountability_lists_DOS_(1,2,3,...).docx
	-- Abstract out word doc creation

- BOTH Missing List / Sub List
	-- Load RG, TD, and VD lists from file AND have default lists if file is not found
